## Purpose

**The main intention of Creating this project or website is to make the beginner in web development feel comfortable with the measuring units of Css and its frameworks**

<br>
<br>

## Where do we use commonly use it

**We use it in ever part of the css which it comes to size below are some examples which will make you understand**

```css
font-size: 30px;
width: 100px;
height: 300px;
```

## Well

The px is the basic unit of the css and it can is the fix in size it does not change as the ratio of the screen hence many developer do not use the **PX** unit. But it does not mean that we have to drop out this topic. This is the most important thing you have to know at the beginning of you _Web Development Practice_ because it's the unit only if you get this topic you can move furthur.

**Px Stand for Pixels**

> ## Fluctuating Units / Relative Units

Hence the _Fluctuating_ word refers to the changing in the size or lenght of a html or documnent elements and this is only with the **Vw and Vh**. There is way where we can set PX and make a Responsive webpage. But it is not that effective. It takes allot of efforts and practice.

> ## That two unit are

- Viewport Width (Vw)
- Viewport Height (Vh)

### ViewPort Width (Vw)

- 1Vw unit is equal to the one unit of the total width of the screen
  if Screen Width 720px then 1vw = 7.2px. the difference between % and Vw is Vw relates to the total width of the screen but % relates to the parent class

- Vw is used when you are making a responsive website and for different aspect ratio(Screen Sizes)
  It takes in action when the width of a website is compressed or expanded. Because There are allot of the devices and aspect ratios, an d Cannot be Mentioned Or Styled Individually. So Its has been mandatory to use Vw make you webpage look better in ever size, Because different element are set in bigger or Smaller size in the default browser size. But if it is used from mobile it make differ and may not match to the mobiles aspect ratio . You may have noticed many website which if opened in mobile they stay the same as the desktops size. To avoid this an make your Website look Cool and Responsive we relative units are used.
